# Advent of Code

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

This is a parent repository for all of my Advent of Code solutions. This is used for learning purposes to practice my problem solving skills and improve code quality. Primarily using TypeScript.
